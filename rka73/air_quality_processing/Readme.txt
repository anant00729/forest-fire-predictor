* "Station and region summaries"  Folder
  - This is the folder that contains the actual project files and scripts to get summaries for both the stations and regions.

* "station summaries only" Folder
  - This folder contains all scripts and commands to get averages for stations in BC.
    But, later we realized that we need region summaries too, so we modified the scripts and queries and instead put them in "Station and region summaries"  Folder.
